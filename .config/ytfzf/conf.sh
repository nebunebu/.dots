# This is a sample config file, refer to ytfzf(5) for more information

# In the previous version of ytfzf this file had all the examples, with all defaults set,
# this has been changed because it made it impossible for us to change default values that were broken or causing bugs,
# as everyone used the default configuration file.
# we are now going to only have this sample config file, and the ytfzf(5) manual, which has explanation of every variable and function that can be set.

#a sample config below:

# Variables {{{
ytdl_pref="248+bestaudio/best"
sub_link_count=1
# thumbnail_viewer="sixel"
show_thumbnails=0
fancy_subs=1
is_loop=1
notify_playing=0
#}}}
