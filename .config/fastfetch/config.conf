# Fastfetch system configuration
# This file sets the default config for all users of the system.

# For more information about how configuration files work,
# see ~/.config/fastfetch/config.conf, generated during first run.
# All options that can be put there (or passed as argument) can be put here too.

# Use fastfetch --print-config-system > /etc/fastfetch/config.conf
# to overwrite this file with the current default file.

# User config option
# Sets if fastfetch should load user provided configuration.
# If this is off, fastfetch ignores the user config file and any passed arguments
# Must be true or false
# Default is true.
